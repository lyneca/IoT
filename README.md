# IoT
This is a HSC SDD/IPT project that uses a set of sensorboards to monitor climate data.
The main file you should run right now is `new_grapher.py`, but it won't work unless you have the sensorboards.

If you've got an Arduino and want to look at the code, the Arduino code is in `sensorboard/sensorboard.ino`.

# Files:
 - new_grapher.py: entrance file on Windows with the dependencies and Python installed.
 - linux.py: entrance file for a terminal-based environment.
 - dist/new_grapher.py: entrance file on Windows for systems without python and/or dependencies.
