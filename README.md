# IoT
This is a HSC SDD/IPT project that uses a set of sensorboards to monitor climate data.
The main file you should run right now is `new_grapher.py`, but it won't work unless you have the sensorboards.

If you've got an Arduino and want to look at the code, the Arduino code is in `sensorboard/sensorboard.ino`.
