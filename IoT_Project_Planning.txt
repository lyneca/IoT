    - Sensors pick up data and communicate it with a server
    - Server then makes decisions
      - Whether to turn the aircon/lights on in a room
      - Tell via sound whether there is a class in the room
      - Sustainability
        - Notify when the aircon isn't needed
      - How loud particular classes are
        - If the class next door is doing a test, it can notify the loud peeps
  - Planning
    - Cost
    - Arduino Nano: $5
    - WiFi module: $5
    - Temp Sensor: $0.75
    - Light Sensor: $0.95
    - Sound Sensor: $0.75
    - Total: $12.65 per unit
    - Five units: $63.25

    - Data
      - Collect average noise levels for classes
        - Leave a sensor bot in a classroom and at the end ask how noisy it was
          (Qualitative)
      - Collate into table (data vs time) and identify trends
        - Sound
          - Noisy classes
            - Next to tests
        - Light
          - Lights left on overnight
        - Temperature
          - Average temperatures with/without aircon
        - Sound vs Temperature
          - Comfort study (hot students = rousy students)
  - IO chart
    - Input
      - Light
      - Sound
      - Temperature
    - Output
      - LEDs
      - LCD?
      - Speaker/buzzer?
